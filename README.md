**Lun Coin Bot**


The Lun Coin Bot is a feature-rich Discord bot designed to bring an engaging virtual economy and interactive gaming experience to your server. It boasts a global coin system, allowing users to earn, spend, and compete across all servers where the bot is active.

**Key Features Include:**

**Coin Economy:** Users can earn coins through daily rewards (/daily), begging (/beg), and various games.

**Interactive Games:** Test your luck with commands like /flip (coin flip), /roll (dice roll), and more.

**Raiding System:** Engage in thrilling /raid attempts to steal coins from others, with outcomes and notifications for both parties.

**Safe Mode Banking:** Protect your earnings by activating safe mode (/bank_deposit), making you immune to raids (and preventing you from raiding others) for a cooldown period. Deactivate anytime with /bank_withdraw.

**Pet Shop:** Spend your coins on a variety of adorable virtual pets via the /shop command, which are then proudly displayed on your /profile.

**Leaderboards:** Compete to be the richest with the /leaderboard command.

**User Profiles:** View your personal coin balance, safe mode status, owned pets, and server roles with /profile.

**Dual Command Support:** Seamlessly use both Discord Slash Commands (/command) and traditional Prefix Commands ($command).

**Persistent Data:** All user data, including balances, pets, and safe mode status, is securely stored using Firebase Firestore.


**Built with Node.js and Discord.js, and hosted on Render, the Lun Coin Bot offers a stable and fun experience for your community.**
